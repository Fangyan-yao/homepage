Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently an Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research interests lie in numerical analysis and scientific computing. I have recently been interested in geometrical PDEs, fluid-structure interation and nonlinear dispersive equations.
